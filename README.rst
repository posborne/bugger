Bugger Debugging Tools
=======================

Quick Overview
--------------

Bugger is a collection of debugging tools for python applications.  All the
tools in the project have a couple common ideas/features that help to make
the library cohesive and easily usable in your application.

  * Bugger tools help you debug your application by integrating in with
    your existing application, avoiding interference at all costs.

  * The Bugger tools have minimal dependencies.  If you have python 2.4+
    and the standard library, you should be able to use the tools.

  * The Bugger tools are well designed.  Sane defaults are provided to get
    you up-and-running quickly, but it is understood that you may need to
    customize things to fit your needs, we try to make this easy.

  * The Bugger tools are well documented.  Sphinx documentation for the
    project is regularly updated and available at 
    http://packages.python.org/bugger/
